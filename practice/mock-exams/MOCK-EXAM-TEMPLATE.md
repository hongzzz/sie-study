## Generation Guidelines for Claude

### When Creating Mock Exam [N]:

1. **Source Questions**:
   - Pull from existing practice questions in `practice/questions/domain-XX/`
   - Create new questions using `question-template.md`
   - Ensure proper distribution by domain (12/33/23/7)

2. **Difficulty Balance**:
   - Don't make exam too easy (inflated confidence)
   - Don't make exam too hard (deflated confidence)
   - Match actual SIE difficulty distribution

3. **Avoid Repetition**:
   - Don't reuse same questions across multiple mock exams
   - Vary scenarios and wording
   - Test same concepts with different approaches

4. **Quality Checks**:
   - Every question has clear correct answer
   - All wrong answers are plausible but clearly wrong
   - Explanations are thorough
   - No typos or ambiguous wording

5. **Timing**:
   - First mock: After 60% content (Week 8-9)
   - Second mock: 2 weeks before exam (Week 14)
   - Third mock: 1 week before exam (Week 15)
