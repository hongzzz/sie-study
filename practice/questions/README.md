## How to Use Practice Questions

### 1. Domain-Specific Practice
After completing each domain, practice questions from that domain folder.

**Recommended approach**:
- Study a topic

- Review wrong answers immediately
- Redo wrong questions later

### 2. Mixed Practice
Once you've covered multiple domains, mix questions for better retention.

### 3. Timed Practice
As you get closer to the exam, practice under timed conditions:
- 75 questions in 105 minutes
- Average 1.4 minutes per question

### 4. Track Your Progress
Keep a log of your practice sessions:

| Date | Domain | Questions | Score | Weak Areas |
|------|--------|-----------|-------|------------|
| 2025-01-15 | Domain 1 | 20 | 85% | Economic indicators |
