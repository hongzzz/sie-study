## Detailed Explanations | 详细解析

### Question 1 - Answer: B

**Correct Answer: B**

**✓ Why B is correct**:
- **Capital gain**: Stock purchased at $50, now worth $60 = $10/share gain × 100 shares = $1,000 gain
  - **Status**: **UNREALIZED** because the investor has NOT sold the stock yet (only "paper gain")
- **Dividend income**: Company paid $2/share × 100 shares = $200
  - **Status**: **REALIZED** because cash dividend was received

**✗ Why other options are wrong**:
- **A**: Capital gain is NOT realized - investor still holds the stock. Only selling would realize the gain.
- **C**: Dividends cannot be "unrealized" - once received, they are immediately realized income
- **D**: Dividend income is already realized (cash received). Only capital gain remains unrealized.

**Key Concepts Tested**: Realized vs Unrealized Income, Dividend Income, Capital Gain

**Common Mistake**: Confusing realized and unrealized gains. Remember:
- **Dividend = Realized immediately** upon receipt
- **Capital Gain = Unrealized** until stock is sold

**Study Tip**: Think of "realized" as "turned into cash." Dividends = instant cash = instant realization. Capital gains = only cash when you sell.

---

### Question 2 - Answer: C

**Correct Answer: C**

**✓ Why C is correct**:
This is a **cumulative preferred stock**, meaning unpaid dividends accumulate as arrears.

**Calculation**:
```
Annual dividend = $100 par × 5% = $5 per share

Year 1 (missed): $5
Year 2 (missed): $5
Year 3 (current): $5

Total payment required = $5 + $5 + $5 = $15 per share
```

The company must pay ALL accumulated arrears ($10 from past 2 years) PLUS current year dividend ($5) before paying common stockholders anything.

**✗ Why other options are wrong**:
- **A**: This only accounts for current year dividend ($5), ignoring 2 years of arrears
- **B**: This only accounts for the 2 years of arrears ($10), forgetting current year's $5
- **D**: This is the par value, not the dividend amount

**Key Concepts Tested**: Cumulative Preferred Stock, Dividend Arrears, Calculation

**Formula to Remember**:
```
Total Cumulative Dividend = (Annual Dividend × Years Missed) + Current Year Dividend
```

**Study Tip**: "Cumulative" means "Company must Catch up" - all past missed dividends MUST be paid before common stockholders get anything.

### Question 3 - Answer: B

**Correct Answer: B**

**✓ Why B is correct**:
Must calculate the **conversion price** to determine if conversion is profitable.

**Calculation**:
```
Step 1: Calculate Conversion Price
Conversion Price = Par Value ÷ Conversion Ratio
                 = $100 ÷ 5 shares
                 = $20 per share

Step 2: Compare to Current Common Stock Price
Current common price: $18
Conversion price: $20

$18 < $20 → Conversion NOT profitable
```

**Verification**:
If converted: 5 shares × $18 = $90 value
If not converted: Preferred worth $100 par value
$90 < $100 → Would lose $10 by converting

**Rule**: Only convert when **Common Stock Price > Conversion Price**

**✗ Why other options are wrong**:
- **A**: False - common stock is trading BELOW conversion price ($18 < $20), not above
- **C**: Mathematical error - if common value is $90 and preferred is $100, converting would LOSE money ($90 < $100)
- **D**: Conversion price is $20 ($100 ÷ 5), not $18

**Key Concepts Tested**: Convertible Preferred Stock, Conversion Price, Conversion Ratio

**Formula to Remember**:
```
Conversion Price = Par Value ÷ Conversion Ratio
Convert when: Current Common Price > Conversion Price
```

**Common Mistake**: Forgetting to calculate conversion price and just comparing par value to total common stock value.

### Question 4 - Answer: B

**Correct Answer: B**

**✓ Why B is correct**:
An investor who **expects interest rates to decline** is most suitable for callable preferred because:

1. **Current advantage**: Callable preferred pays **higher dividend** now (to compensate for call risk)
2. **Expected outcome**: When rates decline, company will likely call the stock
3. **Investor's mindset**: This investor EXPECTS to be called - they accept it because they enjoyed the higher yield period
4. **Strategy**: Lock in high yield now, knowing it won't last forever (already priced into their expectation)

**Real scenario**:
- Buys callable preferred at 7% yield
- Enjoys high income while rates are high
- When rates drop to 4%, gets called (as expected)
- Has already benefited from the higher yield period

**✗ Why other options are wrong**:
- **A**: Retiree needs **stable, LONG-TERM income** - callable stock can be taken away (reinvestment risk), disrupting income. Should choose NON-callable.
- **C**: Callable vs Non-Callable has nothing to do with default protection. Both have same priority in bankruptcy. This is about interest rate risk, not credit risk.
- **D**: Young growth investors should look at common stock or convertible preferred, not callable preferred which offers no growth potential.

**Key Concepts Tested**: Callable Preferred Stock, Interest Rate Risk, Investor Suitability, Reinvestment Risk

**Study Tip**: Callable preferred = "Enjoy high yield now, but company can take it back when rates drop." Only suitable for investors who expect/accept this outcome, not those needing permanent income.

### Question 5 - Answer: A

**Correct Answer: A**

**✓ Why A is correct**:
Must analyze ALL features of both stocks comprehensively:

**Stock X Analysis**:
| Feature | Type | Impact |
|---------|------|--------|
| Cumulative | ✓ Investor benefit | Dividends accumulate if missed |
| Non-Callable | ✓ Investor benefit | Can't be taken away |
| Convertible | ✓ Investor benefit | Upside potential |
| **Result** | **Triple investor protection** | Lower dividend (4%) acceptable |

**Stock Y Analysis**:
| Feature | Type | Impact |
|---------|------|--------|
| Non-Cumulative | ✗ Company benefit | Missed dividends forfeited |
| Callable | ✗ Company benefit | Reinvestment risk |
| Non-Convertible | ✗ No growth potential | No upside participation |
| **Result** | **Triple disadvantage** | Higher dividend (7%) compensates |

**Key insight**: Stock X has **better protection** (cumulative, non-callable) AND **upside potential** (convertible) - the complete package. The 3% higher dividend on Stock Y merely compensates for its three unfavorable features.

**"Suitable for most investors"**: Most investors prefer protection + growth opportunity over just high current income with risks.

**✗ Why other options are wrong**:
- **B**: Ignores that high dividend (7%) is COMPENSATION for three unfavorable features, not an advantage itself
- **C**: Not equally attractive - Stock X clearly has better investor protections and growth potential
- **D**: Stock Y is **non-convertible** - it has NO growth potential. If anything, Stock X (convertible) is better for growth-oriented investors

**Key Concepts Tested**: Cumulative/Non-Cumulative, Callable/Non-Callable, Convertible/Non-Convertible, Risk-Return Balance, Investor Suitability

**Comparison Table** (Quick Reference):
| Feature | Stock X | Stock Y |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Cumulative? | Yes ✓ | No ✗ |
| Callable? | No ✓ | Yes ✗ |
| Convertible? | Yes ✓ | No ✗ |
| **Dividend** | 4% | 7% (compensates) |
| **Best for** | Most investors | Specific high-income seekers |

**Study Tip**: When comparing preferred stocks, don't just look at dividend rate. Analyze ALL three feature dimensions. Higher dividend usually means WORSE features (company's way of compensating for unfavorable terms).
