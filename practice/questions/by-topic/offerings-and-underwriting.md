## Detailed Explanations | 详细解析

### Question 1 - Answer: B

**Correct Answer: B) $190 million**

**✓ Why B is correct**:
In a **firm commitment** underwriting, the investment bank purchases ALL securities from the issuer upfront at the agreed price. The issuing company receives: 10 million shares × $19 = **$190 million**. This amount is guaranteed regardless of how many shares the underwriter actually sells to the public. The company's proceeds are NOT affected by the public sales.

**✗ Why other options are wrong**:
- **A) $160 million**: This is what the public paid (8M × $20), but the company doesn't receive public proceeds directly in firm commitment - they already got paid by the underwriter
- **C) $200 million**: This would be if all shares sold at $20, but again, the company doesn't receive the public offering price in firm commitment
- **D) It depends on...**: This would be true for **best efforts**, not firm commitment. In firm commitment, the issuer's proceeds are fixed and certain

**Key Concepts Tested**: Firm Commitment, Principal Role, Risk Allocation

**Common Mistake**: Confusing firm commitment with best efforts. Remember: Firm Commitment = underwriter BUYS first, then sells = issuer gets CERTAIN proceeds.

**Study Tip**: Think "Firm = FIRMLY guaranteed money for the company"

---

### Question 2 - Answer: C

**Correct Answer: C) It means the disclosure requirements have been met**

**✓ Why C is correct**:
The SEC's role is to ensure **full and fair disclosure**. When the SEC approves a registration statement, it means only that the company has disclosed all required information adequately. The SEC does NOT evaluate the investment merit, quality of the company, or whether it's a good investment. The prospectus even includes a disclaimer stating this explicitly.

**✗ Why other options are wrong**:
- **A) SEC believes it's a good investment**: The SEC explicitly does NOT make investment recommendations or judgments about whether securities are good investments
- **B) Guarantees accuracy**: The SEC reviews for completeness and adequacy of disclosure, but does not guarantee accuracy. Companies and their officers are responsible for truthfulness
- **D) Protects from losses**: The SEC protects investors' right to information, not from market losses. Investors can still lose money even with full disclosure

**Key Concepts Tested**: SEC Role, Registration Statement, Disclosure Principle

**Study Tip**: SEC = referee ensuring rules are followed (disclosure), NOT coach telling you which team to bet on (investment advice)

---

### Question 3 - Answer: C

**Correct Answer: C) Selling group**

**✓ Why C is correct**:
The **selling group** acts as an **agent** (not principal). They help sell securities but do NOT purchase them. If they cannot sell the shares, they simply return them to the syndicate. They earn only a selling concession (commission) for shares actually sold, and bear NO financial risk.

**✗ Why other options are wrong**:
- **A) Lead underwriter**: Assumes the MOST risk - typically takes the largest allocation in a firm commitment and must purchase those shares
- **B) Syndicate members**: Assume risk proportional to their allocation - they purchase securities and must hold unsold shares
- **D) All assume equal risk**: False - risk is allocated differently. Lead and syndicate assume risk; selling group does not

**Key Concepts Tested**: Syndicate Structure, Selling Group, Risk Allocation, Principal vs Agent

**Common Mistake**: Thinking selling group is part of the syndicate. They participate in distribution but are NOT underwriters.

**Comparison Table**:
| Party | Purchases Securities? | Bears Risk? | Compensation |
|-------|---------------------|------------|--------------|
| Lead/Syndicate | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Full spread |
| Selling Group | ❌ No | ❌ No | Concession only |

---

### Question 4 - Answer: B

**Correct Answer: B) Who bears the risk if securities don't sell**

**✓ Why B is correct**:
This is THE fundamental difference:
- **Firm Commitment**: Investment bank (underwriter) bears the risk - they buy securities upfront
- **Best Efforts**: Issuing company bears the risk - underwriter only tries to sell, doesn't buy

This risk allocation determines everything else: proceeds certainty, compensation structure, who holds unsold securities.

**✗ Why other options are wrong**:
- **A) Offering price**: The public offering price can be the same in both methods - this is not the distinguishing factor
- **C) Length of offering period**: Not the primary difference - both can have similar timeframes
- **D) SEC approval requirements**: Both require SEC registration and approval - same regulatory process

**Key Concepts Tested**: Firm Commitment vs Best Efforts, Risk Allocation, Principal vs Agent

**Study Tip**: Everything flows from risk allocation. If you remember who bears the risk, you can deduce proceeds certainty, compensation type, and what happens to unsold shares.

---

### Question 5 - Answer: C

**Correct Answer: C) $28.5 million**

**✓ Why C is correct**:
In **best efforts** underwriting, the company receives proceeds only from shares actually sold, minus the commission:
- Shares sold: 6 million × $5 = $30 million gross
- Commission (5%): $30M × 0.05 = $1.5 million
- Company receives: $30M - $1.5M = **$28.5 million**

The company does NOT receive the $50M target because only 60% of shares sold, and this is best efforts (not firm commitment).

**Calculation**:
```
Step 1: Calculate gross proceeds from sold shares
6,000,000 shares × $5 = $30,000,000

Step 2: Calculate commission
$30,000,000 × 5% = $1,500,000

Step 3: Net to company
$30,000,000 - $1,500,000 = $28,500,000
```

**✗ Why other options are wrong**:
- **A) $50 million**: This would be the target if ALL shares sold, but only 6M out of 10M sold
- **B) $30 million**: This forgets to subtract the 5% commission
- **D) $47.5 million**: This seems to confuse best efforts with firm commitment pricing

**Key Concepts Tested**: Best Efforts Underwriting, Commission Calculation, Proceeds Uncertainty

**Formula to Remember**:
```
Best Efforts Proceeds = (Shares Sold × Price) × (100% - Commission%)
```

---

### Question 6 - Answer: C

**Correct Answer: C) Management fee**

**✓ Why C is correct**:
The **management fee** is paid ONLY to the **lead underwriter** (also called managing underwriter or book-running manager) for organizing the offering, conducting due diligence, pricing, and managing the syndicate. Other syndicate members do NOT receive this fee - it's exclusive compensation for the lead's additional responsibilities.

**✗ Why other options are wrong**:
- **A) Underwriting fee**: ALL syndicate members receive this (proportional to their allocation), not just the lead
- **B) Selling concession**: Anyone who sells shares receives this - lead, syndicate members, even selling group
- **D) Commission**: This term is more associated with best efforts or agency relationships, not the spread components in firm commitment

**Key Concepts Tested**: Spread Components, Lead Underwriter, Syndicate Compensation

**Study Tip**:
```
Spread Components = "MUS"
M = Management fee (Lead only)
U = Underwriting fee (all Underwriters/syndicate)
S = Selling concession (all Sellers)
```

---

### Question 7 - Answer: C

**Correct Answer: C) To reduce disclosure and regulatory requirements** (Remember: **EXCEPT** question)

**✓ Why C is correct (it's the FALSE statement)**:
Going public actually **INCREASES** disclosure and regulatory requirements, not reduces them. Public companies must:
- File quarterly (10-Q) and annual (10-K) reports with SEC
- Disclose material events (8-K filings)
- Comply with Sarbanes-Oxley Act
- Follow exchange listing requirements
- Hold annual shareholder meetings

This is one of the major DRAWBACKS of going public, not a benefit.

**✗ Why other options are wrong (they are TRUE reasons for IPO)**:
- **A) Raise capital**: TRUE - One of the primary reasons companies go public
- **B) Provide liquidity**: TRUE - IPO creates an exit opportunity for early investors, VCs, and allows employee stock options to become liquid
- **D) Increase visibility**: TRUE - Being publicly traded increases prestige, media attention, and brand recognition

**Key Concepts Tested**: IPO Benefits and Drawbacks, Public Company Requirements

**EXCEPT Question Strategy**: Three answers will be true benefits; find the one that's actually a DISadvantage.

**Study Tip**: IPO = more money, more liquidity, more visibility, but also MORE regulatory burden (not less)

---

### Question 8 - Answer: B

**Correct Answer: B) The lead underwriter**

**✓ Why B is correct**:
In **firm commitment** underwriting, the lead underwriter and syndicate purchased ALL the shares from the issuer before selling to the public. If the market price falls:
- They may be unable to sell remaining shares at the planned price
- They might have to sell at a loss (below what they paid the issuer)
- They're stuck holding shares that have decreased in value
- They bear the FULL financial loss

The lead underwriter typically has the largest allocation, so suffers the most.

**✗ Why other options are wrong**:
- **A) Issuing company**: Already received their money from the underwriter upfront in firm commitment - they're unaffected by post-IPO price movements
- **C) Investors who purchased**: They are negatively affected (lost money), but the question asks who is MOST affected. The underwriter faces larger aggregate losses
- **D) SEC**: The SEC doesn't buy or sell securities, so is not financially affected by price changes

**Key Concepts Tested**: Firm Commitment, Risk Allocation, Market Risk

**Common Mistake**: Thinking the company suffers - but remember, in firm commitment, the company already got paid!

**Study Tip**: Firm Commitment = company walks away with cash, underwriter holds the bag if price drops

---

### Question 9 - Answer: C

**Correct Answer: C) Best efforts with all-or-none provision**

**✓ Why C is correct**:
The company's concern is raising **insufficient** capital (less than $40M needed). Options:

**Why C is BEST**:
- **All-or-None (AON)** provision requires selling ALL 10M shares ($50M) or the entire offering is CANCELLED
- If the company sets a minimum of $40M (8M shares) in the AON provision, it ensures they either get enough money or the deal is off
- Protects company from being stuck with insufficient capital
- Investors' money is returned if minimum not met

**✗ Why other options are less suitable**:
- **A) Firm commitment**: This WOULD work (guaranteed proceeds), but many underwriters won't offer firm commitment to small companies due to risk. If available, this would actually be best, but the question implies the company has limited options
- **B) Best efforts only**: Company could end up with $20M if only half sells - insufficient for their needs
- **D) Syndicate underwriting**: "Syndicate" describes the structure (multiple underwriters), not the commitment type. Could still be best efforts with no minimum

**Key Concepts Tested**: All-or-None, Best Efforts, Capital Requirements, Risk Management

**Common Mistake**: Thinking best efforts is always bad - AON provision makes it safer for the issuer

**Study Tip**: All-or-None = "all $50M or nothing" - protects against partial funding

---

### Question 10 - Answer: D

**Correct Answer: D) SEC's recommendation on whether to invest** (Remember: **EXCEPT** question)

**✓ Why D is correct (it's what's NOT included)**:
The prospectus will NEVER include SEC recommendations on whether to invest. The SEC explicitly does NOT:
- Recommend or disapprove securities
- Judge investment merit
- Provide investment advice

The prospectus includes a disclaimer: "These securities have not been approved or disapproved by the SEC."

**✗ Why other options are wrong (they ARE required in prospectus)**:
- **A) Business description**: REQUIRED - detailed description of company operations, products, markets, competition
- **B) Financial statements (3 years)**: REQUIRED - audited financial statements for at least three years
- **C) List of risks**: REQUIRED - the "Risk Factors" section must detail ALL material risks facing the company and the investment

**Key Concepts Tested**: Prospectus Requirements, SEC Role, Disclosure

**EXCEPT Question Strategy**: Three items are required disclosures; find the one that's explicitly NOT included.

**Study Tip**: SEC's job = ensure company tells you the risks, NOT tell you whether to buy
