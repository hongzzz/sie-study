## Detailed Explanations | 详细解析

### Question 1 - Answer: B

**Correct Answer: B**

**✓ Why B is correct**:
The SEC is indeed a federal government agency (not an SRO) that was created by Congress in 1934 to regulate the securities markets. Its primary mission is to protect investors by ensuring adequate disclosure of material information. The SEC reviews prospectuses, regulates trading, and oversees the securities industry. The key phrase "ensures adequate disclosure" captures the SEC's core function - it doesn't recommend investments, but ensures companies disclose all material facts.

**✗ Why other options are wrong**:
- **A**: This describes FINRA, not the SEC. FINRA is a self-regulatory organization (SRO) that oversees broker-dealers and administers exams like the SIE, Series 7, etc.
- **C**: This describes SIPC, not the SEC. SIPC provides insurance protection up to $500,000 ($250,000 for cash) when broker-dealers fail.
- **D**: This describes MSRB, not the SEC. MSRB creates rules specifically for the municipal securities market.

**Key Concepts Tested**: SEC, Federal Government Agency, Disclosure

**Common Mistake**: Confusing the SEC with FINRA. Remember: SEC = government (highest authority), FINRA = industry SRO (focuses on broker-dealer conduct).

**Study Tip**: Remember the hierarchy - SEC is at the TOP, supervising all other regulatory organizations including FINRA, MSRB, and SIPC.

### Question 2 - Answer: B

**Correct Answer: B**

**✓ Why B is correct**:
FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) is the organization responsible for overseeing the day-to-day conduct of broker-dealers and their registered representatives. Churning - excessive trading to generate commissions - is a violation of FINRA's suitability and ethical conduct rules. FINRA has the authority to investigate such complaints, discipline the broker, impose fines, or even revoke the broker's license. Investors can file complaints through FINRA's website or contact their complaint center.

**✗ Why other options are wrong**:
- **A**: While the SEC has ultimate regulatory authority, it typically doesn't handle individual complaints about broker conduct. The SEC focuses on broader market regulation and major violations. Individual broker conduct issues are FINRA's domain.
- **C**: SIPC only provides insurance protection when a broker-dealer fails/goes bankrupt. It does NOT handle complaints about broker misconduct or unethical behavior. SIPC doesn't regulate or discipline brokers.
- **D**: MSRB creates rules for municipal securities only. It doesn't oversee general broker conduct, and it doesn't enforce its own rules - it's purely a rulemaking body.

**Key Concepts Tested**: FINRA, Broker Conduct, Suitability, Churning

**Common Mistake**: Thinking the SEC handles all securities-related complaints. In reality, FINRA handles day-to-day broker conduct issues.

**Study Tip**: FINRA = **F**irm behavior. When the question involves broker or broker-dealer conduct/ethics, think FINRA first.

### Question 3 - Answer: B

**Correct Answer: B**

**✓ Why B is correct**:
SIPC coverage has specific limits: $500,000 maximum per account, with a cash sublimit of $250,000. Let's calculate:
- Stocks: $400,000 (fully covered - under the limit)
- Cash: $300,000, but only $250,000 covered (cash sublimit applies)
- **Total SIPC coverage: $400,000 + $250,000 = $650,000**

The investor would have a shortfall of $50,000 on the excess cash.

**Calculation**:
```
Account holdings:
  Stocks: $400,000
  Cash:   $300,000
  Total:  $700,000

SIPC Coverage:
  Stocks: $400,000 (fully covered, under $500K limit)
  Cash:   $250,000 (limited by cash sublimit)
  Total:  $650,000

Shortfall: $700,000 - $650,000 = $50,000
```

**✗ Why other options are wrong**:
- **A**: $500,000 is the maximum total coverage per account, but this doesn't account for the fact that stocks ($400K) + maximum cash coverage ($250K) can exceed $500K when calculated separately. The $500K limit applies to the total, but the cash sublimit of $250K also applies.
- **C**: $700,000 would be full coverage of all assets, but SIPC doesn't cover amounts over the limits. The cash portion exceeds the $250K cash sublimit.
- **D**: $250,000 is only the cash limit, not the total coverage. This ignores the $400K in stocks that would also be covered.

**Key Concepts Tested**: SIPC Coverage Limits, Cash Sublimit

**Formula to Remember**:
```
SIPC Coverage Limits:
- Maximum total: $500,000 per account
- Maximum cash: $250,000 (within the total)
- Securities: Remainder up to $500,000
```

**Study Tip**: Remember "**5-2-5**": **$500K** total, **$250K** cash max, **5** in both numbers.

### Question 4 - Answer: C

**Correct Answer: C** (Remember: **EXCEPT** question)

**✓ Why C is correct**:
This is the FALSE statement, which makes it the correct answer for an EXCEPT question. The SEC NEVER recommends any investment as suitable. This is a critical concept: SEC approval means only that the disclosure is adequate - the SEC has reviewed the prospectus and determined that material information has been disclosed. The SEC does not evaluate the quality of the investment, does not endorse it, does not guarantee returns, and absolutely does not recommend it. The SEC's role is disclosure verification, not investment advice.

**✗ Why other options are wrong (they are TRUE statements)**:
- **A**: TRUE - SEC approval does indicate that disclosure is adequate. This is the primary function of SEC review.
- **B**: TRUE - Material risks must be disclosed in the prospectus. The SEC ensures that significant risks are not hidden from investors.
- **D**: TRUE - Required financial information (audited financial statements, business description, use of proceeds, etc.) must be provided and the SEC verifies this.

**Key Concepts Tested**: SEC Role, Disclosure vs. Recommendation, Prospectus Review

**EXCEPT Question Strategy**: For EXCEPT/NOT questions, you're looking for the FALSE statement. Three answers will be correct statements; pick the odd one out. Always watch for words like "recommends," "guarantees," or "endorses" in SEC questions - the SEC never does these things.

**Study Tip**: SEC = **Disclosure Police**, NOT **Investment Advisor**. The SEC is like a food label inspector - they make sure all ingredients are listed, but they don't tell you which food tastes best.

### Question 5 - Answer: A

**Correct Answer: A**

**✓ Why A is correct**:
This answer correctly identifies the unique division of labor in municipal securities regulation. MSRB (Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board) creates the rules for municipal securities, including disclosure requirements, sales practices, and professional standards. However, MSRB does NOT enforce its own rules - it's purely a rulemaking body. Enforcement is handled by other agencies: FINRA enforces MSRB rules for broker-dealers, the SEC enforces them for issuers, and bank regulators enforce them for bank dealers. This question specifically asks about broker-dealer enforcement, so FINRA is the correct enforcer.

**✗ Why other options are wrong**:
- **B**: While the SEC does have broad authority over securities regulation, it does NOT create the specific rules for municipal securities - that's MSRB's role. Also, MSRB doesn't enforce rules, so the second part is wrong.
- **C**: FINRA does not create rules for municipal securities; it only enforces MSRB rules when broker-dealers are involved. SEC enforces MSRB rules for issuers, not broker-dealers.
- **D**: MSRB only creates rules; it has NO enforcement authority. This is a key distinction that the exam often tests.

**Key Concepts Tested**: MSRB, Rulemaking vs. Enforcement, Municipal Securities, FINRA Enforcement

**Comparison Table** (Quick Reference):
| Function | MSRB | FINRA | SEC |
|----------|------|-------|-----|
| Makes municipal bond rules | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Enforces rules for broker-dealers | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (oversight) |
| Enforces rules for issuers | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

**Study Tip**: Remember "**MSRB Makes, Doesn't Enforce**" - MSRB is the **rulebook writer**, while SEC and FINRA are the **enforcers**. Think of MSRB as the building code committee (writes standards) and FINRA/SEC as the inspectors (enforce standards).
