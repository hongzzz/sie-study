## Question 1

Which of the following best describes the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)?

A) A self-regulatory organization that oversees broker-dealers and administers qualification exams

B) A federal government agency that regulates securities markets and ensures adequate disclosure

C) A non-profit corporation that provides insurance protection when broker-dealers fail

D) An organization that creates rules for the municipal securities market

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**:
The SEC is a federal government agency created in 1934 to regulate securities markets. Its primary mission is protecting investors by ensuring adequate disclosure of material information. The SEC reviews prospectuses, regulates trading, and oversees the securities industry.

✗ Why other options are wrong:
- A: Describes FINRA (SRO that oversees broker-dealers and administers exams)
- C: Describes SIPC (provides insurance up to $500K when broker-dealers fail)
- D: Describes MSRB (creates municipal securities rules)

**Key Concepts**: SEC, Federal Government Agency, Disclosure
**Difficulty**: ⭐ Easy

## Question 2

**Scenario**: An investor discovers that her broker has been frequently buying and selling securities in her account to generate commissions, a practice known as "churning."

Which regulatory organization should she contact to file a complaint about her broker's conduct?

A) SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)

B) FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority)

C) SIPC (Securities Investor Protection Corporation)

D) MSRB (Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board)

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**:
FINRA oversees the day-to-day conduct of broker-dealers and registered representatives. Churning violates FINRA's suitability and ethical conduct rules. FINRA can investigate, discipline brokers, impose fines, or revoke licenses.

✗ Why other options are wrong:
- A: SEC handles broader market regulation, not individual broker conduct complaints
- C: SIPC only provides insurance when broker-dealers fail; doesn't handle misconduct
- D: MSRB creates municipal bond rules only; doesn't oversee general broker conduct

**Key Concepts**: FINRA, Broker Conduct, Suitability
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐ Medium

## Question 3

**Scenario**: A brokerage firm goes bankrupt. An investor has an account containing $400,000 in stocks and $300,000 in cash.

How much will SIPC coverage provide to this investor?

A) $500,000 total

B) $650,000 total

C) $700,000 total

D) $250,000 total

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**:
SIPC coverage: $500,000 maximum per account, with cash sublimit of $250,000.

Calculation:
- Stocks: $400,000 (fully covered)
- Cash: $250,000 (limited by cash sublimit, not full $300,000)
- **Total coverage: $650,000**

Shortfall: $50,000 on excess cash

✗ Why other options are wrong:
- A: Doesn't account for stocks ($400K) + maximum cash ($250K) exceeding $500K total when separate
- C: Would be full coverage, but cash exceeds $250K limit
- D: Only the cash limit; ignores $400K in stocks

**Key Concepts**: SIPC Coverage Limits, Cash Sublimit ($500K/$250K)
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐ Medium

## Question 4

SEC approval of a company's IPO prospectus indicates all of the following **EXCEPT**:

A) The disclosure in the prospectus is adequate

B) Material risks have been disclosed to investors

C) The SEC recommends this as a suitable investment

D) Required financial information has been provided

**Answer**: C (EXCEPT question)

**Explanation**:
The SEC NEVER recommends any investment. SEC approval means only that disclosure is adequate - the SEC has verified that material information has been disclosed. The SEC does not evaluate investment quality, endorse investments, or guarantee returns.

✗ Why other options are correct (we're looking for the EXCEPT):
- A: TRUE - SEC approval means disclosure is adequate
- B: TRUE - Material risks must be disclosed
- D: TRUE - Required financial information must be provided

**Key Concepts**: SEC Role, Disclosure vs. Recommendation
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐ Medium
**Note**: SEC = Disclosure Police, NOT Investment Advisor

## Question 5

**Scenario**: A city issues general obligation bonds to fund a public library. A broker-dealer fails to provide required disclosures when selling these bonds.

Which organization creates the disclosure rules for municipal bonds, and which organization enforces these rules for broker-dealers?

A) MSRB creates the rules; FINRA enforces them

B) SEC creates the rules; MSRB enforces them

C) FINRA creates the rules; SEC enforces them

D) MSRB creates and enforces the rules

**Answer**: A

**Explanation**:
MSRB (Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board) creates rules for municipal securities, but does NOT enforce them. Enforcement is handled by:
- FINRA: for broker-dealers
- SEC: for issuers
- Bank regulators: for bank dealers

This question asks about broker-dealer enforcement, so FINRA is correct.

✗ Why other options are wrong:
- B: SEC doesn't create municipal bond rules (that's MSRB); MSRB doesn't enforce
- C: FINRA doesn't create municipal bond rules, only enforces them
- D: MSRB only creates rules; has NO enforcement authority

**Key Concepts**: MSRB, Rulemaking vs. Enforcement, FINRA Enforcement
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐ Hard
**Study Tip**: "MSRB Makes, Doesn't Enforce"
