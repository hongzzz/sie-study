---

### Question-Answering Strategies

#### 1. Read Carefully

**Watch for Key Words**:
- **EXCEPT** / **NOT** - looking for the one that doesn't fit
- **ALWAYS** / **NEVER** - usually wrong (too absolute)
- **MOST LIKELY** / **BEST** - choose the most appropriate answer
- **FIRST** / **LAST** - order matters

**Example**:
> "Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of common stock?"

This is asking for the FALSE statement.

---

#### 2. Process of Elimination

**Steps**:
1. Read question completely
2. Eliminate obviously wrong answers
3. Choose between remaining options
4. If stuck between two, trust your first instinct

**Mark Clearly Wrong Answers** (on scratch paper):
- A: ❌
- B: ❌
- C: ?
- D: ?

Now choose between C and D.

---

#### 3. Handling Difficult Questions

**If You Don't Know**:
1. Mark it for review (use exam software feature)
2. Make your best guess
3. Move on - don't dwell
4. Come back if time permits

**Never Leave Blank**: There's no penalty for wrong answers, so always guess.

---

#### 4. Common Question Types

**Definition Questions**:
> "What is a debenture?"
- Straightforward - either you know it or you don't
- Use glossary knowledge

**Scenario Questions**:
> "An investor seeks stable income with low risk. Which product is most suitable?"
- Think about product characteristics
- Match to investor profile

**Calculation Questions**:
> "A bond with a 5% coupon and $1,000 par value pays how much interest annually?"
- Use formulas you've memorized
- Double-check math

**Regulatory Questions**:
> "Which act created the SEC?"
- Memorization - know your acts and years

**Comparison Questions**:
> "What is the difference between a GO bond and a revenue bond?"
- Know distinguishing features

5. **Neglecting Prohibited Activities**
   - These are heavily tested and often scenario-based

6. **Forgetting Bond Price-Yield Inverse Relationship**
   - Rates ↑, Prices ↓ (and vice versa)

7. **Mixing Up Account Types**
