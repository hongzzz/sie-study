## Important Note

The SIE exam is **not heavily calculation-based**. Most questions test conceptual understanding rather than complex math. However, you should be comfortable with these basic calculations.

**Calculator**: You will have access to a basic calculator during the exam.

## Stock Calculations

### 1. Current Dividend Yield | 当前股息收益率

```
Current Dividend Yield = Annual Dividend / Current Market Price
```

**Example**:
- Stock price: $50
- Annual dividend: $2
- Current Yield = $2 / $50 = 4%

---

### 2. Earnings Per Share (EPS) | 每股收益

```
EPS = Net Income / Shares Outstanding
```

**Example**:
- Net Income: $1,000,000
- Shares Outstanding: 100,000
- EPS = $1,000,000 / 100,000 = $10

---

### 3. Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E) | 市盈率

```
P/E Ratio = Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share
```

**Example**:
- Stock price: $50
- EPS: $5
- P/E = $50 / $5 = 10

**Interpretation**: Investors willing to pay $10 for every $1 of earnings

---

## Bond Calculations

### 1. Current Yield | 当前收益率

```
Current Yield = Annual Interest Payment / Current Market Price
```

**Example**:
- Bond: $1,000 par, 5% coupon
- Current price: $950
- Annual interest: $1,000 × 5% = $50
- Current Yield = $50 / $950 = 5.26%

**Key Relationships**:
- Bond at **premium** (price > par) → Current Yield < Coupon Rate
- Bond at **par** (price = par) → Current Yield = Coupon Rate
- Bond at **discount** (price < par) → Current Yield > Coupon Rate

---

### 2. Annual Interest Payment | 年度利息支付

```
Annual Interest = Par Value × Coupon Rate
```

**Example**:
- Par value: $1,000
- Coupon rate: 6%
- Annual interest = $1,000 × 6% = $60

**Note**: Most bonds pay semi-annually, so each payment = $30

---

### 3. Accrued Interest | 应计利息

```
Accrued Interest = (Annual Interest / 360) × Days Since Last Payment
```

**Example**:
- Annual interest: $60
- Days since last payment: 90
- Accrued Interest = ($60 / 360) × 90 = $15

**Corporate/Municipal bonds**: 30-day months, 360-day year
**Government bonds**: Actual days, actual year

---

## Margin Account Calculations

### 1. Regulation T Initial Requirement | T规则初始保证金要求

```
Reg T Requirement = 50% of purchase price
```

**Example - Long Purchase**:
- Buy 100 shares at $50 = $5,000
- Reg T requirement: $5,000 × 50% = $2,500
- Can borrow: $2,500

---

### 2. Equity in Long Margin Account | 多头保证金账户权益

```
Equity = Market Value - Debit Balance
```

**Example**:
- Purchased: $10,000 worth of stock
- Deposited: $5,000 (50%)
- Borrowed: $5,000 (debit balance)
- Current market value: $12,000
- Equity = $12,000 - $5,000 = $7,000

---

### 3. Minimum Maintenance Requirement | 最低维持保证金

```
Minimum Maintenance = 25% of Market Value
```

**Example**:
- Current market value: $8,000
- Minimum maintenance = $8,000 × 25% = $2,000
- If equity falls below $2,000 → Margin call

---

### 4. Margin Call Amount | 追加保证金金额

```
Margin Call = Amount Needed to Reach Minimum Maintenance
```

**Example**:
- Market value: $8,000
- Debit balance: $6,500
- Current equity: $8,000 - $6,500 = $1,500
- Minimum required: $8,000 × 25% = $2,000
- Margin call: $2,000 - $1,500 = $500

---

## Mutual Fund Calculations

### 1. Net Asset Value (NAV) | 资产净值

```
NAV = (Total Assets - Total Liabilities) / Shares Outstanding
```

**Example**:
- Total assets: $100,000,000
- Total liabilities: $1,000,000
- Shares outstanding: 10,000,000
- NAV = ($100M - $1M) / 10M = $9.90

---

### 2. Sales Charge % | 销售费用百分比

```
Sales Charge % = (POP - NAV) / POP × 100
```

Where:
- POP = Public Offering Price (what investor pays)
- NAV = Net Asset Value

**Example**:
- NAV: $10.00
- POP: $10.50
- Sales Charge % = ($10.50 - $10.00) / $10.50 × 100 = 4.76%

**Maximum sales charge**: 8.5% for mutual funds

---

### 3. Public Offering Price (POP) | 公开发行价

```
POP = NAV / (1 - Sales Charge %)
```

**Example**:
- NAV: $10.00
- Sales charge: 5%
- POP = $10.00 / (1 - 0.05) = $10.00 / 0.95 = $10.53

---

## Options Calculations

### 1. Intrinsic Value | 内在价值

**Call Option**:
```
Intrinsic Value = Market Price - Strike Price (if positive, else 0)
```

**Put Option**:
```
Intrinsic Value = Strike Price - Market Price (if positive, else 0)
```

**Example - Call**:
- Stock price: $55
- Strike price: $50
- Intrinsic value = $55 - $50 = $5

**Example - Put**:
- Stock price: $45
- Strike price: $50
- Intrinsic value = $50 - $45 = $5

---

### 2. Time Value | 时间价值

```
Time Value = Option Premium - Intrinsic Value
```

**Example**:
- Call premium: $7
- Intrinsic value: $5
- Time value = $7 - $5 = $2

---

### 3. Breakeven Points | 盈亏平衡点

**Long Call**:
```
Breakeven = Strike Price + Premium Paid
```

**Long Put**:
```
Breakeven = Strike Price - Premium Paid
```

**Example - Long Call**:
- Strike: $50
- Premium: $3
- Breakeven = $50 + $3 = $53

**Example - Long Put**:
- Strike: $50
- Premium: $2
- Breakeven = $50 - $2 = $48

---

## Return Calculations

### 1. Total Return | 总回报

```
Total Return = (Ending Value - Beginning Value + Income) / Beginning Value × 100
```

**Example**:
- Bought stock: $50
- Sold stock: $60
- Dividends received: $2
- Total Return = ($60 - $50 + $2) / $50 × 100 = 24%

---

### 2. Capital Gain/Loss | 资本利得/损失

```
Capital Gain = Sale Price - Purchase Price - Commissions
```

**Example**:
- Bought: $1,000
- Sold: $1,200
- Commissions: $20 total
- Capital Gain = $1,200 - $1,000 - $20 = $180

---

## Quick Reference Tables

### Bond Price-Yield Relationships

| Bond Status | Price | Current Yield vs. Coupon | YTM vs. Current Yield |
|-------------|-------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **At Par** | $1,000 | CY = Coupon | YTM = CY |
| **Premium** | > $1,000 | CY < Coupon | YTM < CY |
| **Discount** | < $1,000 | CY > Coupon | YTM > CY |

### Options In/At/Out of the Money

| Option Type | In-the-Money | At-the-Money | Out-of-the-Money |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Call** | Market > Strike | Market = Strike | Market < Strike |
| **Put** | Market < Strike | Market = Strike | Market > Strike |

---

## Common Calculation Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Bond Current Yield**: Divide by current price, NOT par value
2. **Sales Charge %**: Divide by POP, NOT NAV
3. **Margin Equity**: Remember to subtract debit balance from market value
4. **Options Intrinsic Value**: Can never be negative (use 0 if calculation is negative)
5. **Accrued Interest**: Corporate bonds use 30/360, Treasuries use actual/actual

## Exam Tips

- Show your work (on scratch paper provided)
- Round carefully - usually to 2 decimal places
- Watch for trick questions (asking for what investor pays vs. receives)
- Double-check whether question asks for $ amount or %
- Remember: Most SIE questions are conceptual, not calculation-heavy

**Practice makes perfect!** Work through calculation problems in the practice sections.
