## Domain-Specific Notes | 领域特定笔记

### What's Working Well:
✅ "Preferred = Priority in Money" mnemonic very effective
✅ Student grasped the counterintuitive nature of "preferred" quickly
✅ Comparison table format (Common vs Preferred) works well
✅ Concrete examples help (dividends, voting rights scenarios)

### Common Challenges to Watch For:
⚠️ **Bond pricing**: Inverse relationship with interest rates can be confusing
⚠️ **Options**: Calls vs Puts often mixed up - use strong mnemonics
⚠️ **Calculations**: Multiple formulas (current yield, dividend yield, etc.) - systematic practice needed
⚠️ **Municipal bonds**: Tax treatment specifics require careful explanation

### Teaching Strategies for Domain 2:
💡 **Equities**: Use real companies as examples (Tesla, Apple work well)
💡 **Bonds**: Explain with "lending money to friend" analogy first
💡 **Options**: Teach with clear buyer vs seller perspective
💡 **Investment Companies**: Compare to "buying a basket" vs individual items
💡 **Risks**: Create comprehensive risk comparison table across all products

### Student's Key Insights:
- **Session 1 (2025-12-22)**: "Preferred股 = 拿钱优先，不是投票优先" - great understanding!
- **Session 6 (2025-01-09)**: Grasped risk-return balance principle immediately - "features favoring company → higher dividend"; Strong investor matching skills - correctly identified callable suitable for rate-decline expectations, not retirees; "Best of Both Worlds" concept for convertible preferred clicked perfectly; Conversion Price calculation mastered on first try
