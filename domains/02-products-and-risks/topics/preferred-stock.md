## Pre-Learning Assessment Questions | 课前评估问题

Before diving into this topic, let's assess your baseline understanding:

1. What do you think "Preferred" means in Preferred Stock? Preferred by whom?

2. If a company makes profit, who gets paid first - common stockholders or preferred stockholders?

3. What's the difference between dividend and capital gain?

**Purpose**: These questions help identify what you already know and where to focus our learning.

## Core Concepts | 核心概念

### Concept 1: Return Types - Dividend vs Capital Gain | 股票收益类型

**Definition** (Bilingual):
- **Dividend (股息)**: Cash or stock distributed to shareholders from company profits - received while holding the stock
- **Capital Gain (资本利得)**: Profit from selling stock at higher price than purchase price - only realized when sold

**Key Points**:
- **Dividend = Realized immediately** when received (cash in hand)
- **Capital Gain = Unrealized** until stock is sold ("paper gain")
- Different investors prefer different return types based on their needs

**Real-World Example**:
You buy 100 shares of Apple at $50/share ($5,000 total investment).
- One year later: Stock price = $60/share, Apple pays $2/share dividend
- **Dividend income**: $200 (100 shares × $2) - **Realized** ✓
- **Capital gain**: $1,000 (100 shares × $10 price increase) - **Unrealized** until you sell

**For SIE Exam**:
- Typical question: "Which income is realized?"
- Key fact: Dividend = always realized when received; Capital gain = unrealized until sold

---

### Concept 2: Preferred Stock vs Common Stock | 优先股 vs 普通股

**Definition**:
- **Preferred Stock (优先股)**: Equity security with fixed dividend and priority over common stock, but typically no voting rights
- **Common Stock (普通股)**: Basic equity ownership with voting rights and variable dividends, but junior claim

**Key Points**:
- **"Preferred" = Priority in money** (dividends + liquidation), NOT voting
- **"Common" = Common people vote** (voting rights), but last in line for money
- Preferred Stock = "Stock that acts like a bond" (fixed income)
- Common Stock = True ownership with unlimited upside potential

**Complete Comparison Table**:

| Feature | Common Stock | Preferred Stock |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Dividend** | Variable, board decides | Fixed rate (e.g., 6% of par) |
| **Dividend Priority** | Last (after Preferred) | First (before Common) |
| **Voting Rights** | Yes (1 share = 1 vote) | Usually NO |
| **Liquidation Priority** | Last (residual claim) | Before Common, after bonds |
| **Price Volatility** | High | Lower (more stable) |
| **Growth Potential** | Unlimited upside | Limited (fixed income focus) |
| **Suitable For** | Growth investors | Income investors |

**For SIE Exam**:
- Typical question: "Which stockholders receive dividends first?"
- Key trap: Preferred usually has NO voting rights (not "more" voting rights)

---

### Concept 3: Cumulative vs Non-Cumulative | 累积 vs 非累积

**Definition**:
- **Cumulative Preferred**: Unpaid dividends accumulate as "arrears" and must be paid before common dividends
- **Non-Cumulative Preferred**: Unpaid dividends expire - no obligation to make up missed payments

**Key Points**:
- Cumulative = Better investor protection (company must catch up on missed dividends)
- Non-Cumulative = Favors company (missed dividends are gone forever)
- Cumulative preferred typically pays **lower** dividend rate (better protection = lower yield)

**Real-World Example**:
ABC Company has preferred stock with $5/year dividend. Company doesn't pay for 2 years due to losses.

**Year 3, company recovers and wants to pay dividends**:
- **If Cumulative**: Must pay $5(Y1) + $5(Y2) + $5(Y3) = **$15** to preferred before ANY to common
- **If Non-Cumulative**: Only pays current year $5, past $10 is **forfeited**

**For SIE Exam**:
- Calculation question: "How much must cumulative preferred receive if dividends were skipped for X years?"
- Formula: (Annual dividend × # of years skipped) + current year dividend

---

### Concept 4: Callable vs Non-Callable | 可赎回 vs 不可赎回

**Definition**:
- **Callable Preferred**: Company has right to buy back (redeem) stock at predetermined call price
- **Non-Callable Preferred**: Company cannot force redemption - investor keeps stock indefinitely

**Key Points**:
- **Callable = Favors company** (can refinance when rates drop)
- **Non-Callable = Favors investor** (locks in income stream)
- Callable preferred pays **higher** dividend (compensates for reinvestment risk)
- Call typically happens when interest rates decline

**Real-World Example**:
**2020**: Company issues Callable Preferred at 5% dividend, call price = $105
**2025**: Market rates drop to 3%

**Company's decision**:
- Calls back old 5% preferred (pays $105/share)
- Issues new 3% preferred
- **Saves 2% annually on dividends**

**Investor's problem**:
- Lost 5% income stream
- Can only reinvest at 3% now (Reinvestment Risk)

**For SIE Exam**:
- Scenario question: "Why would company call preferred stock?" (Answer: Interest rates declined)
- Key concept: Callable preferred has higher dividend to compensate for call risk

---

### Concept 5: Convertible vs Non-Convertible | 可转换 vs 不可转换

**Definition**:
- **Convertible Preferred**: Can be exchanged for common stock at predetermined conversion ratio
- **Non-Convertible Preferred**: Cannot be converted - remains preferred stock

**Key Points**:
- **Convertible = "Best of Both Worlds"**: Fixed dividend + growth potential
- Conversion Ratio: Number of common shares per preferred share (e.g., 1 preferred → 5 common)
- Conversion Price: Par Value ÷ Conversion Ratio (breakeven point)
- Convertible pays **lower** dividend (growth potential = compensation)

**Real-World Example**:
You own Convertible Preferred:
- Par Value: $100
- Dividend: 5% ($5/year)
- Conversion Ratio: 4 shares of common stock
- **Conversion Price**: $100 ÷ 4 = **$25/share**

**When to convert?**
| Common Stock Price | 4 Shares Value | Convert? |
|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| $20 | $80 | ❌ Lose $20 |
| $25 | $100 | 🟡 Break even |
| $40 | $160 | ✅ Gain $60 |
| $80 | $320 | ✅✅ Gain $220 |

**Rule**: Convert when **Common Stock Price > Conversion Price**

**For SIE Exam**:
- Calculation: Conversion Price = Par Value ÷ Conversion Ratio
- Scenario: "Should investor convert?" (Compare common price to conversion price)

## Comparison Tables | 对比表格

### Three Feature Dimensions of Preferred Stock

| Feature | Option A | Option B | Better for Investor | Dividend Usually |
|---------|----------|----------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Dividend Accumulation** | Cumulative | Non-Cumulative | Cumulative ✓ | Cumulative = Lower |
| **Redemption** | Callable | Non-Callable | Non-Callable ✓ | Callable = Higher |
| **Conversion** | Convertible | Non-Convertible | Convertible ✓ | Convertible = Lower |

### Investor Suitability Matching

| Investor Type | Needs | Best Stock Type | Reason |
|--------------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **Retiree** | Stable income | Non-Callable, Non-Convertible, High dividend | Needs reliable long-term income |
| **Young Professional** | Growth + Income | Convertible, Cumulative | Can participate in company growth |
| **Conservative** | Safety + Income | Cumulative, Non-Callable | Maximum protection |
| **Rate Speculator** | Short-term income | Callable | Willing to accept call risk for higher yield |

## Common Misconceptions | 常见误解

### Misconception 1: "Preferred" means more voting power
**Wrong**: Preferred stockholders have MORE voting rights than common stockholders
**Right**: Preferred stockholders typically have NO voting rights
**Why the confusion**: "Preferred" sounds like "better in every way," but it only means priority for money (dividends and liquidation), not control

### Misconception 2: Higher dividend always means better investment
**Wrong**: Stock Y pays 7% vs Stock X's 4%, so Y is better
**Right**: Must examine ALL features - high dividend often compensates for unfavorable features (non-cumulative, callable, non-convertible)
**Why the confusion**: People focus on yield number without considering risk factors

### Misconception 3: Convertible preferred always better than non-convertible
**Wrong**: Convertible is always the best choice
**Right**: Depends on investor needs - retirees may prefer non-convertible with higher dividend over conversion feature they won't use
**Why the confusion**: Conversion seems like "free option," but you pay for it through lower dividend

## Memory Aids | 记忆技巧

### Mnemonics | 助记词
- **Preferred Stock** = "**P**riority for **P**ayment, not **P**ower"
- **Cumulative** = "**C**ompany must **C**atch up"
- **Callable** = "**C**ompany **C**an take it back"
- **Convertible** = "**C**hoice to **C**hange to common"

### Core Principle | 核心原则
**"Who benefits → How compensated"**
- Company benefits (Callable, Non-Cumulative) → **Higher dividend** to attract investors
- Investor benefits (Non-Callable, Cumulative, Convertible) → **Lower dividend** acceptable

### Analogies | 类比
- **Preferred Stock** is like **VIP concert tickets**: You get priority entry (dividends) and better seating (liquidation), but you don't get to vote on the playlist (no voting rights)
- **Callable Preferred** is like **fixed-rate mortgage that bank can cancel**: Great rate now, but bank can force refinance when rates drop
- **Convertible Preferred** is like **buffet with regular menu**: You can enjoy fixed menu (dividend) or switch to à la carte (common stock) if something better appears

## Formulas & Calculations | 公式与计算

### Formula 1: Cumulative Dividend Arrears
```
Total Payment = (Annual Dividend × Years Missed) + Current Year Dividend
```

**Example**:
Given: $6 annual dividend, missed 3 years
Calculate: Total payment before common stockholders get anything

Solution:
```
= ($6 × 3 years) + $6 current
= $18 + $6
= $24 per share
```

### Formula 2: Conversion Price
```
Conversion Price = Par Value ÷ Conversion Ratio
```

**Where**:
- Par Value = Face value of preferred stock (usually $100)
- Conversion Ratio = Number of common shares per preferred share

**Example**:
Given: Par = $100, Ratio = 5
Calculate: At what common stock price is conversion profitable?

Solution:
```
Conversion Price = $100 ÷ 5 = $20/share
```
**Answer**: When common stock > $20, conversion is profitable

### Formula 3: Conversion Value
```
Conversion Value = Common Stock Price × Conversion Ratio
```

**Example**:
Given: Common stock = $30, Conversion Ratio = 4
Calculate: What's the preferred stock worth if converted?

Solution:
```
= $30 × 4 shares
= $120
```
Compare to Par Value ($100) → Gain of $20 by converting

## Verification Questions | 理解验证问题

### Question 1 (Concept Recall)
In your own words, explain what makes Preferred Stock "preferred" and what stockholders give up in exchange.

**Expected Understanding**:
- Preferred = priority for dividends and liquidation (money comes first)
- Give up = voting rights (no say in company decisions)
- Also give up = unlimited upside potential (fixed dividend, not participating in growth unless convertible)

---

### Question 2 (Application)
A company had financial difficulties and didn't pay preferred dividends for 3 years. This year they recovered. They have both cumulative and non-cumulative preferred stock outstanding. Explain what happens when they want to resume paying dividends.

**Expected Understanding**:
- Cumulative: Must pay all 3 years of arrears + current year before ANY to common
- Non-Cumulative: Past 3 years forfeited, only pay current year
- This demonstrates the protection difference between the two types

---

### Question 3 (Investor Matching)
A 65-year-old retiree needs $50,000 annual income for living expenses. Would you recommend callable or non-callable preferred stock? Why?

**Expected Understanding**:
- Recommend: Non-callable (even with lower dividend)
- Reason: Retiree needs reliable long-term income stream
- Callable risk: If called back, loses income source and faces reinvestment risk
- Retiree can't afford income disruption

---

## Practice Application Scenario | 实践应用场景

### Scenario 1: Comparing Investment Options

**Context**:
You have $10,000 to invest and are comparing two preferred stocks from the same utility company:

**Stock A**:
- Cumulative, Non-Callable, Non-Convertible
- Annual dividend: 6.5%
- Current price: $100/share

**Stock B**:
- Cumulative, Non-Callable, Convertible (ratio: 4)
- Annual dividend: 4.5%
- Current price: $100/share
- Current common stock price: $20

**Questions**:
1. Which provides higher current income?
2. Why does Stock B pay lower dividend?
3. At what common stock price would Stock B become more valuable?
4. Which would you choose if you're 30 years old with stable job? Which if you're 70 and retired?

**Discussion Points**:
- Stock A: $650/year income, no growth potential
- Stock B: $450/year income, but conversion option at $25/share breakeven
- Young investor (30): Stock B better - time for company to grow, can afford lower income now
- Retired (70): Stock A better - needs higher income now, less concerned about growth

### Scenario 2: Callable Preferred During Rate Changes

**Context**:
2020: You bought callable preferred stock at par ($100), 7% dividend, call price $103
2025: Market interest rates dropped from 7% to 4%

**Questions**:
1. Why did the company issue callable (vs non-callable) preferred?
2. Will the company likely call this stock? Why?
3. If called, what's your problem?
4. Did you "lose money" if called at $103?

**Discussion Points**:
- Company benefits from callable: Can refinance when rates drop (7% → 4% saves 3% annually)
- Investor faces reinvestment risk: Got $103, but can only reinvest at 4% now (lost 7% income stream)
- Technically gained $3 on call premium, but lost future high-yield income
- This is why callable preferred must pay higher dividend initially

## For SIE Exam | 针对 SIE 考试

### Typical Question Types

1. **Conceptual** (Definition/Understanding)
   - "Which of the following best describes cumulative preferred stock?"
   - "Preferred stockholders typically have which right?"

2. **Scenario** (Application/Investor Suitability)
   - "An investor seeks stable income with minimal risk. Which is most suitable?"
   - "A retiree needs reliable monthly income. Which preferred stock feature is most important?"

3. **Calculation** (Cumulative Dividends, Conversion)
   - "If cumulative preferred missed 2 years of $5 dividends, how much must be paid before common?"
   - "Preferred with par $100 converts to 4 common shares. What's the conversion price?"

4. **Comparison** (Feature Analysis)
   - "What is the main difference between callable and non-callable preferred?"
   - "Why does convertible preferred typically pay lower dividend than non-convertible?"

### Weight/Importance
- **Exam Coverage**: Medium-High (part of 44% Products domain)
- **Typical # of Questions**: 3-5 questions on preferred stock features
- **Difficulty Level**: ⭐⭐ Medium (requires understanding multiple features and investor matching)

### Key Facts to Memorize
- Preferred = Priority for dividends/liquidation, but usually NO voting rights
- Cumulative = Dividends accumulate if unpaid (better for investor)
- Callable = Company can buy back (favors company, higher dividend)
- Convertible = Can exchange for common stock (favors investor, lower dividend)
- Conversion Price = Par Value ÷ Conversion Ratio
- Convert when: Common Stock Price > Conversion Price
- **Principle**: Features favoring company → higher dividend; favoring investor → lower dividend

### Common Exam Traps
- ❌ Thinking "preferred" means better voting rights
- ❌ Forgetting cumulative dividends accumulate (not just current year)
- ❌ Assuming higher dividend always means better investment (must check all features)
- ❌ Thinking dividend can be "unrealized" (dividend is always realized when received)

### Study Priority
**High** - This is a foundational topic for Domain 2 (highest weight domain). Understanding preferred stock features and investor suitability is critical for many exam questions. Also provides foundation for understanding other securities.
