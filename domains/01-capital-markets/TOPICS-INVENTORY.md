✅ Real-world examples (Tesla, Apple) very effective
✅ Visual comparisons (NYSE vs NASDAQ table) helpful

### Common Challenges:
⚠️ Need to watch for: Confusing which regulatory agency does what

💡 Use current news for economic factors (inflation, Fed rate changes)
💡 Regulatory agencies: Create comparison table from the start
💡 Offerings: Walk through recent IPO as case study
