## Domain-Specific Notes | 领域特定笔记

### Teaching Strategies for Domain 3:

**Order Types**:
💡 Use scenarios: "Stock at $50, you want to buy only if it drops to $45 - what order?"
💡 Create decision tree: "Want to buy? → At any price (Market) or specific price (Limit)?"

**Account Types**:
💡 Real-life examples: Married couple (JTWROS), business partners (TIC)
💡 Comparison table works well (like Common vs Preferred Stock)

**Margin Accounts**:
💡 Use simple numbers for Reg T calculations
💡 "You want $10,000 of stock, how much must you deposit?" (Answer: $5,000 if Reg T = 50%)

**Prohibited Activities**:
💡 Use memorable, realistic scenarios (NOT dry regulatory text)
💡 "Why is this wrong?" approach - Socratic method ideal here
💡 Compare to everyday ethics: "Would you do this as a business person?"
💡 Case studies work well (anonymized real violations)

### Common Challenges to Anticipate:

⚠️ **Order types**: Stop vs Stop-Limit confusion
- Solution: Clear trigger vs execution price distinction

⚠️ **JTWROS vs TIC**: Rights of survivorship concept
- Solution: "What happens when one person dies?" scenario

⚠️ **Margin calculations**: Math anxiety
- Solution: Start simple (50% = half), then build complexity

⚠️ **Prohibited activities**: Memorization of many rules
- Solution: Understand WHY prohibited (protect investors, fair markets)

### Expected Student Questions:
- "What's the difference between a stop order and stop-limit order?"
- "Why would someone use JTWROS instead of TIC?"
- "How do I calculate margin requirements?"
- "Why is churning prohibited if trading makes money for the client?"
