## When to Start This Domain | 何时开始本领域

### Prerequisites:
- **Recommended**: Complete Domains 1, 2, and 3 first
- **Why**: Understanding what's being regulated helps understand the regulations
- **Ideal Position**: 60-70% overall progress before starting Domain 4

### Optimal Timing:
- **Week 10-12** of study plan
- After mastering:
  - Domain 1: Capital Markets ✅ (understand market structure)
  - Domain 2: Products & Risks ✅ (know what products exist)
  - Domain 3: Trading & Accounts ✅ (understand prohibited activities context)

### Current Recommendation:
⏸️ **Wait** - Save this for later in your study plan
- Domain 4 is the smallest (9%) and most memorization-heavy
- Better to learn regulations AFTER understanding what they regulate
- Many regulations already mentioned in other domains
- Best studied in final 4-6 weeks before exam

## Why Study This Domain Last | 为什么最后学习这个领域

**Strategic Reasons**:
1. **Context Matters**: Easier to remember "Securities Act of 1933 regulates new issues" AFTER you understand what new issues are (Domain 1)
2. **Repetition Works**: You'll encounter regulations throughout other domains (e.g., Reg T in Domain 3, Reg D in Domain 1)
3. **Fresh for Exam**: Memorization-heavy content benefits from being studied close to exam date
4. **Lowest Weight**: 9% = ~7 questions. Focus on 44% domain (Domain 2) first
5. **Integration Phase**: By Week 10-12, you can connect regulations to all previously learned content

**Exception**: If you have strong legal/regulatory background, you could start earlier

## Next Session Recommendations (When Ready) | 下次会话建议

### When you're ready to start Domain 4:

**Option A: 1933 vs 1934 Acts** ⭐ Recommended First Topic
- **Why**: Foundation of all securities regulation
- **What to Cover**:
  - 1933 Act (Paper Act) - New issues, registration, prospectus
  - 1934 Act (People Act) - Trading, created SEC, broker-dealer registration
  - Key distinction: Primary vs Secondary market regulation
- **Prerequisites**: Domain 1 understanding (✅ you have 50% complete)
- **Estimated Time**: 1 session (30-40 min)
- **Key Learning**: "1933 = new (3 letters), 1934 = trading (7 letters)" mnemonic
- **Exam Impact**: HIGH - frequently tested distinction

**Option B: SIPC Protection**
- **Why**: Straightforward, frequently tested
- **What to Cover**:
  - $500,000 protection (including $250,000 cash)
  - What SIPC covers vs doesn't cover
  - NOT insurance (protects vs broker-dealer failure, not market loss)
- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Estimated Time**: 20-30 min (shorter topic)
- **Key Learning**: Protection limits and scope
- **Exam Impact**: MEDIUM - 1-2 questions typical

## Domain-Specific Notes | 领域特定笔记

### Teaching Strategies for Domain 4:

**1933 vs 1934 Acts**:
💡 Mnemonic: "1933 = new (3 letters like 'new'), 1934 = trading (7 letters like 'trading')"
💡 Connect to Domain 1: Primary market (1933) vs Secondary market (1934)
💡 Memory aid: "Paper Act" (1933 - registration paperwork) vs "People Act" (1934 - regulates people/broker-dealers)

**Years to Memorize**:
💡 Create timeline: 1933 → 1934 → 1940 → 1940 → 1970
💡 Pattern: "Back-to-back acts in 1940" (Investment Company + Advisers)
💡 "1970s = investor protection era" (SIPC)

**SEC Regulations**:
💡 Group by purpose:
  - Exemptions (Reg D, Reg A)
  - Trading (Reg T)
  - Protection (Reg S-P, Reg BI)
💡 Focus on "why" each regulation exists

**FINRA Rules**:
💡 Connect to Domain 3 prohibited activities
💡 Use scenarios: "Is this communication retail or institutional?"
💡 Emphasize "self-regulation" concept

### Common Challenges to Anticipate:

⚠️ **Years confusion**: Mixing up 1933, 1934, 1940, 1970
- Solution: Timeline visualization, mnemonics

⚠️ **What regulates what**: SEC vs FINRA vs MSRB authority
- Solution: Comparison table with clear jurisdictions

⚠️ **SIPC coverage**: Mixing up limits ($500K total, $250K cash)
- Solution: Concrete examples, "What would SIPC cover?" scenarios

⚠️ **Dry content**: Regulations can feel abstract
- Solution: Connect EVERY regulation to real-world purpose ("Why does this rule exist?")

### Expected Student Questions:
- "What's the difference between 1933 and 1934 Acts?" (VERY common)
- "Does SIPC protect against market losses?" (No - common misconception)
- "Who regulates broker-dealers - SEC or FINRA?" (Both, but different aspects)
- "Do I need to memorize all the years?" (Yes, especially 1933, 1934, 1940, 1970)
