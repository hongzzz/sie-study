**What I knew before this session**:

- Familiar with trading strategies including short selling and options (selling puts for premium)
- Know that companies pay dividends to shareholders

**Questions I had going in**:

3. What are NYSE and NASDAQ differences?

## Key Concepts Learned

### Concept 1: Preferred Stock vs Common Stock

**Definition/Explanation**:
Preferred Stock (优先股) differs from Common Stock (普通股) primarily in terms of **priority**, not voting rights.

**Key Points**:
- **Common Stock**:
  - Has voting rights (can participate in company decisions)
  - Receives dividends AFTER preferred shareholders
  - Last in line during liquidation

- **Preferred Stock**:
  - Usually NO voting rights (or very limited)
  - **Priority** in receiving fixed dividends
  - **Priority** in asset distribution during company liquidation
  - Better suited for investors seeking stable income with lower risk

**Real-World Example**:
Imagine you're a retired investor seeking stable income. You would prefer Preferred Stock because:
- You get paid dividends first (priority)
- Fixed dividend amounts (predictability)
- Less concerned about company voting/control

**Related Concepts**:
- Dividends (分红)
- Risk vs Return trade-off
- Investor profiles (growth vs income investors)

## Teaching Approaches Used

**Questions Claude asked to gauge understanding**:
1. "除了股价上涨，还有其他获利方式吗？"
   - My response: Mentioned short selling and selling put options for premium
   - Claude redirected: Asked about long-term holding and dividends

2. "优先股是不是有更高的决策权？"
   - My initial thought: Yes, preferred = higher voting rights
   - Claude's approach: Used scenario-based questioning to guide discovery

**Analogies/Examples that helped**:
- Two investor types scenario:
  - Investor A wants control → chooses Common Stock
  - Investor B wants stable income → chooses Preferred Stock
- Dividend payment queue analogy: Preferred shareholders get paid first

**Scenarios discussed**:
- Company dividend distribution: Who gets paid first?
- Company liquidation: Who recovers investment first?
- Investment goals: Control vs Income preference

---

## Knowledge Gaps Identified

**Concepts I'm still unclear about**:
1. Bond vs Stock differences
   - Why it's confusing: Have heard of bonds but don't understand key distinctions
   - Plan to clarify: Will cover in upcoming sessions

2. NYSE vs NASDAQ differences
   - Why it's confusing: Both are exchanges, unclear what makes them different
   - Plan to clarify: Part of Capital Markets domain learning

3. Mutual Funds and ETFs
   - Why it's confusing: Know ETFs are "on-exchange funds" and involve stock bundles, but unclear on mechanics
   - Plan to clarify: Will learn in Investment Companies section

4. Regulatory bodies (SEC, FINRA)
   - Why it's confusing: Not familiar with their roles
   - Plan to clarify: Part of Regulatory Framework domain

**Common mistakes I made**:
1. Thinking "Preferred" meant voting priority → Correct understanding: It means dividend and liquidation priority
2. Mentioned trading strategies (short selling, options) when asked about returns → Correct understanding: Dividends are the key passive income from holding stocks

## Mastery Self-Assessment

**For each topic covered today, rate your understanding**:

| Topic | Understanding Level | Confidence | Needs Review? |
|-------|-------------------|------------|---------------|
| Common Stock basics | 🟨 Good | Medium | No |
| Preferred Stock concept | 🟩 Strong | High | No |
| Dividend payments | 🟩 Strong | High | No |

## Verification Questions & Answers

**Questions Claude asked to verify my understanding**:

1. **Q**: 用你自己的话总结一下：如果你是一个追求稳定收入、不想参与公司管理的投资者（比如退休人员），你会更倾向于买普通股还是优先股？为什么？
   - **My A**: 买优先股。因为风险小，回报优先拿到。
   - **Assessment**: ✅ Correct

---

## Personal Notes & Insights

**"Aha!" moments**:
- Realized that "preferred" in finance doesn't mean "better voting power" but rather "priority in payments" - this was counterintuitive at first!
- Understanding that different stocks serve different investor goals (control vs income)

**Memory aids I created**:
- **Preferred = Priority in Money** (not voting)
- Common = Common people vote (democratic rights)

**Connections to previous learning**:
- My P/E ratio knowledge will connect to equity valuation concepts
- Trading experience with options will help when learning derivatives in detail

**Interesting facts or trivia**:
- Most individual investors trade Common Stock
- Preferred Stock behaves somewhat like bonds (fixed payments)

---

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

**Challenge 1**: Initial misconception about preferred stock voting rights
- **How I addressed it**: Claude used scenario-based questioning to guide me to discover the correct answer myself rather than just telling me

**Challenge 2**: Thinking too much about trading strategies rather than fundamental concepts
- **How I addressed it**: Claude refocused the conversation on core investment concepts (dividends, ownership rights)
