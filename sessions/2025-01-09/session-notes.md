## Student's Baseline Knowledge | 学生起始水平

**Before Session**:
- Remembered Preferred Stock has dividend priority (from Session 1)
- Recalled liquidation priority (Preferred before Common)
- Understood basic difference between dividend and capital gain

**Gaps Identified**:
- Didn't know about Cumulative vs Non-Cumulative
- Unfamiliar with Callable and Convertible features
- Didn't understand dividend vs capital gain distinction (realized vs unrealized)

---

## Key Breakthrough Moments | 关键突破时刻

1. **"Preferred" meaning clicked immediately**
   - Student: "又能拿分红，又能享受股价上升的价格" (referring to convertible preferred)
   - Understood "Preferred" = money priority, NOT voting power

2. **Risk-Return Balance Principle mastered**
   - Grasped that features favoring company → higher dividend compensation
   - Conversely, features favoring investor → lower dividend acceptable
   - Applied this principle correctly throughout practice questions

3. **Conversion Price calculation - first try success**
   - Question: "如果我答对了继续即可" after calculating cumulative dividend
   - Self-corrected calculation error immediately ("哦不对是 180000,60000")

4. **Investor Matching - sophisticated understanding**
   - Correctly reasoned why retirees need non-callable (stable long-term income)
   - Understood callable preferred suitable for investors expecting rate declines
   - Differentiated growth vs income investor needs

5. **"Best of Both Worlds" concept**
   - Immediately understood convertible preferred = income security + growth potential
   - Connected this to different life stages (young vs retired)

## Challenges Encountered | 遇到的挑战

### Challenge 1: Callable Preferred Suitability (Question 4)
- **Initial response**: Student chose C (conservative investor)
- **Issue**: Confused callable feature with default protection
- **Resolution**: Explained callable = interest rate risk, not credit risk
- **Outcome**: Student understood callable suitable for investors EXPECTING rate decline, not fearing default

**Teaching adjustment**: Used scenario of investor strategy - "enjoy high yield now, accept being called later" - this framing helped student understand.
