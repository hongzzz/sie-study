## Student Baseline | 学生起点

**Pre-learning assessment summary**:
- **What student knew**: Had heard of SEC and FINRA, but limited details; understood core purpose of regulation (protect investors, prevent fraud)
- **What student didn't know**: Specific roles and differences between agencies; SIPC coverage limits; MSRB's unique structure
- **Starting point**: Good intuition about regulation's purpose; correctly distinguished regulators from exchanges; needed structure to organize the four agencies

## Key Breakthrough Moments | 关键突破点 💡

**Concepts that clicked**:
- **SEC = Disclosure Police, not Investment Advisor**: The FDA analogy resonated - SEC ensures labels are accurate, doesn't say which medicine to take. This clarified that SEC approval ≠ recommendation
- **FINRA as industry self-regulation (SRO)**: Understood the concept that it's not government but industry policing itself (like Bar Association for lawyers)
- **SIPC = Bankruptcy insurance, NOT investment insurance**: Clearly grasped that SIPC protects against broker failure, not market losses
- **MSRB's unique division of labor**: Understood that MSRB makes rules but doesn't enforce them - this was initially surprising but made sense after explanation

**Effective teaching approaches**:
- **Scenario-based learning**: Four real-world scenarios (IPO disclosure, broker churning, broker bankruptcy, municipal bond sales) helped student apply concepts immediately
- **Analogies**: FDA (SEC), Bar Association (FINRA), FDIC (SIPC), Building Code Committee (MSRB) made abstract concepts concrete
- **Comparison table**: Four-agency comparison table provided clear visual organization
- **Memory aids**: "S-F-S-M" (Safe System), "5-2-5" for SIPC, "MSRB Makes, Doesn't Enforce" helped retention

## Challenges Encountered | 遇到的困难 ⚠️

**Initial confusion (all resolved during session)**:
1. **SEC vs FINRA overlap** → Resolved by: Explaining layered regulation - SEC = macro/framework, FINRA = micro/day-to-day conduct
2. **SIPC coverage calculation** → Resolved by: Worked through specific examples with dollar amounts; emphasized cash sublimit of $250K within $500K total

**Concepts demonstrated strong understanding**:
- Student correctly explained SEC vs FINRA division of responsibilities
- Accurately identified that SIPC doesn't cover investment losses
- Understood MSRB makes rules, FINRA/SEC enforce them

**Session ended before completing**:
- Verification scenarios (Questions A-D) were presented but student needed to sleep before answering
- These 4 scenarios remain pending for next session to confirm mastery

## Mastery Assessment | 掌握程度评估

**Overall mastery level**: 🟧 Basic Understanding (strong conceptual grasp, awaiting verification)

| Concept/Subtopic | Mastery Level | Evidence/Notes |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| SEC's role and authority | 🟩 Good | Correctly explained as government agency focused on disclosure, not recommendation |
| FINRA's role as SRO | 🟩 Good | Understood industry self-regulation concept and broker conduct oversight |
| SIPC coverage limits | 🟩 Good | Accurately explained bankruptcy insurance vs investment insurance; knows $500K/$250K limits |
| MSRB structure | 🟩 Good | Clearly understood rulemaking vs enforcement division |
| Four-agency comparison | 🟧 Basic | Can distinguish roles; needs scenario practice to solidify |

**Ready for**:
- [x] Practice questions on this topic (5 questions generated)
- [ ] Verification scenarios completion (4 scenarios pending)
- [ ] Moving to next topic after verification

---

## Next Session Plan | 下次计划

**Recommended options**:

**Option A**: Complete verification scenarios for Regulatory Agencies (4 scenarios, ~10 minutes)
- Consolidates understanding through application
- Achieves mastery-level confidence before moving on

**Option B**: Finish Domain 1 with Economic Factors (~30-40 minutes)
- Last remaining Domain 1 topic: Monetary/fiscal policy, economic indicators
- Would complete foundational domain before moving to Domain 2

**Option C**: Start Domain 2 - Debt Securities (~40-50 minutes)
- Highest exam weight domain (44%)
- Student already has 87.5% of Domain 1 with strong understanding

**Claude's recommendation**: Option A (complete verification) + Option B (Economic Factors) in same session, then move to Domain 2

**Student's expressed preference**: Deferred to Claude's recommendation ("按你建议来")
