## Student Baseline | 学生起点

**Pre-learning assessment summary**:
- **What student knew**: Had heard of SEC and FINRA, but limited details; understood core purpose of regulation (protect investors, prevent fraud)
- **What student didn't know**: Specific roles and differences between agencies; SIPC coverage limits; MSRB's unique structure
- **Starting point**: Good intuition about regulation's purpose; correctly distinguished regulators from exchanges; needed structure to organize the four agencies

## Key Breakthrough Moments | 关键突破点 💡

**Concepts that clicked**:
- **SEC = Disclosure Police, not Investment Advisor**: The FDA analogy resonated - SEC ensures labels are accurate, doesn't say which medicine to take. This clarified that SEC approval ≠ recommendation
- **FINRA as industry self-regulation (SRO)**: Understood the concept that it's not government but industry policing itself (like Bar Association for lawyers)
- **SIPC = Bankruptcy insurance, NOT investment insurance**: Clearly grasped that SIPC protects against broker failure, not market losses
- **MSRB's unique division of labor**: Understood that MSRB makes rules but doesn't enforce them - this was initially surprising but made sense after explanation

**Effective teaching approaches**:
- **Scenario-based learning**: Four real-world scenarios (IPO disclosure, broker churning, broker bankruptcy, municipal bond sales) helped student apply concepts immediately
- **Analogies**: FDA (SEC), Bar Association (FINRA), FDIC (SIPC), Building Code Committee (MSRB) made abstract concepts concrete
- **Comparison table**: Four-agency comparison table provided clear visual organization
- **Memory aids**: "S-F-S-M" (Safe System), "5-2-5" for SIPC, "MSRB Makes, Doesn't Enforce" helped retention

## Challenges Encountered | 遇到的困难 ⚠️

**Initial confusion (all resolved during session)**:
1. **SEC vs FINRA overlap** → Resolved by: Explaining layered regulation - SEC = macro/framework, FINRA = micro/day-to-day conduct
2. **SIPC coverage calculation** → Resolved by: Worked through specific examples with dollar amounts; emphasized cash sublimit of $250K within $500K total

**Concepts demonstrated strong understanding**:
- Student correctly explained SEC vs FINRA division of responsibilities
- Accurately identified that SIPC doesn't cover investment losses
- Understood MSRB makes rules, FINRA/SEC enforce them

**Verification scenarios completed (2025-12-26 continuation)**:
- All 4 scenarios (A-D) completed with 100% accuracy
- Scenario A: SEC disclosure requirements - correctly identified SEC requires disclosure, not investment advice
- Scenario B: FINRA broker misconduct - correctly identified FINRA jurisdiction and suitability rules
- Scenario C: SIPC coverage calculation - accurately calculated $550K recovery ($300K stocks + $250K cash)
- Scenario D: MSRB division of labor - correctly identified MSRB makes rules, FINRA enforces for brokers

## Next Session Plan | 下次计划

**Status**: Verification scenarios ✅ COMPLETED with 100% accuracy

**Recommended options for next session**:

**Option A**: Finish Domain 1 with Economic Factors (~30-40 minutes)
