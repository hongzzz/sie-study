## Teaching Flow | 教学流程

### Part 1: IPO Process & Motivation (15 minutes)

**Approach**: Socratic method - explored WHY companies IPO before HOW

**Key Discussion**:
- Why IPO vs continuing with VC/loans?
  - Student correctly identified: VC needs exit mechanism
  - Student identified pros: raise funds, attract more investment
  - Student identified cons: disclosure obligations, shareholder accountability, profit pressure
- Introduced additional pros/cons student hadn't considered

**IPO Stages Taught**:
1. Selecting Underwriter - Why companies need investment banks
2. Due Diligence & Registration
   - Important discussion about "making financials look good" vs "truthful disclosure"
   - Student correctly understood the difference between presentation and fraud
   - Emphasized SEC's "Full and Fair Disclosure" principle
3. SEC Review - Critical teaching point: SEC approval ≠ recommendation
4. Pricing & Trading

**Breakthrough Moment**: Student clearly understood SEC's role as disclosure regulator, NOT investment advisor. Correctly answered verification question immediately.

---

### Part 2: Firm Commitment vs Best Efforts (20 minutes)

**Approach**: Started with scenario-based teaching using concrete numbers

**Scenario Used**:
- Company wants to issue 10M shares at $20
- Firm Commitment: Underwriter buys at $19.5
- Best Efforts: 3% commission
- Only 8M shares sell to public

**Teaching Progression**:
1. Asked student to predict outcomes under each method
2. Student calculated correctly:
   - Firm Commitment: Company gets $195M (correct!)
   - Best Efforts: Company gets ~$155M (student got the concept, minor calculation adjustment)
3. **Key insight**: Student immediately identified risk bearer in each scenario

**Verification Questions**:
- Q: In Firm Commitment, if only 5M shares sell, how much does company get?
  - Student: Still $195M because underwriter already bought all shares ✅
- Q: Who bears the loss?
  - Student: Underwriter, because they're stuck with unsold shares ✅

**Student's Aha Moment**:
> "Oh, I see - Firm Commitment means ownership transfers to the underwriter FIRST, before they sell to public. So the company already got their money."

This was the breakthrough - student understood the ownership transfer concept perfectly.

---

### Part 3: Syndicate Structure (15 minutes)

**Approach**: Built up from "why multiple banks?" question

**Teaching Progression**:
1. Scenario: $5 billion IPO - can one bank handle it?
   - Student immediately said: "Find multiple banks"
   - Led naturally into syndicate concept
2. Three-tier structure:
   - Lead Underwriter: Most responsibility, most compensation
   - Syndicate Members: Share risk, buy securities
   - Selling Group: No risk, agent role, only concession

**Key Distinction Taught**:
- Syndicate vs Selling Group
- Student correctly identified in verification: Selling Group assumes NO risk

**Spread Distribution**:
- Management Fee → Lead only
- Underwriting Fee → All syndicate members
- Selling Concession → Whoever sells

**Calculation Verification**: Student calculated correctly in comprehensive scenario

---

### Part 4: Comprehensive Scenarios (10 minutes)

**Scenario 1**: TechVision IPO (Firm Commitment)
- 20M shares, public price $25, syndicate buys at $23.25
- Only 15M shares sell (75%)

**Student's Performance**:
- Q: How much does company get? **A: $465M** ✅ Correct
- Q: Syndicate's P&L? **A: -$90M loss** ✅ Correct
- Q: If Best Efforts (5% commission), company gets? **A: $356.25M** ✅ Correct
- Q: Where are unsold shares? **A: In company hands (if Best Efforts)** ✅ Correct understanding

**Initial Minor Confusion**:
- Student initially said unsold shares in "company hands" for Q4
- Thought the question was continuing Best Efforts scenario from Q3
- When clarified it was Firm Commitment, immediately corrected to "Syndicate hands"
- This showed student TRULY understood the difference - not memorizing, but reasoning

**Final Score**: 4/4 = **100% accuracy** on verification questions

---

## Key Concepts Mastered | 已掌握的核心概念

### Excellent Understanding ✅

1. **Risk Allocation** - THE core concept
   - Firm Commitment = underwriter bears risk
   - Best Efforts = issuer bears risk
   - Can explain WHY this affects everything else

2. **Ownership Transfer in Firm Commitment**
   - Understands securities transfer to underwriter BEFORE public sale
   - Company gets guaranteed proceeds regardless of market performance
   - Unsold shares remain with underwriter

3. **SEC's Role**
   - Disclosure regulator, NOT investment evaluator
   - Approval means disclosure adequate, NOT recommended investment
   - Can distinguish this clearly

4. **Syndicate Structure**
   - Lead vs Members vs Selling Group
   - Risk bearing: Lead & Members YES, Selling Group NO
   - Compensation levels correlate with risk

5. **Calculations**
   - Firm Commitment: Company proceeds = all shares × purchase price
   - Best Efforts: Proceeds = (shares sold × price) × (1 - commission%)
   - Underwriter P&L in Firm Commitment scenarios

### Good Understanding 🟩

1. **IPO Process Stages**
   - Knows the sequence: Underwriter → Due Diligence → SEC → Trading
   - Understands purpose of each stage

2. **Prospectus Requirements**
   - Must disclose risks
   - Full and Fair Disclosure principle
   - Difference between presentation and fraud

3. **All-or-None**
   - Variant of Best Efforts
   - Protects issuer from insufficient funding

### Concepts Briefly Mentioned (Not Tested)

- Green Shoe Option / Over-Allotment
- Roadshow
- Book-Building
- S-1 Registration Statement (knew it exists, not tested on details)
