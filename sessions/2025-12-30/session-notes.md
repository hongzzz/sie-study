## Student Baseline | 学生起点

**Pre-learning assessment summary**:
- **What student knew**: Familiar with Fed rate changes from news; understood basic concept of raising rates to control inflation
- **What student didn't know**: Specific Fed tools (OMO, reserve requirement); difference between monetary vs fiscal policy; who controls what
- **Starting point**: Strong economic intuition; correctly explained rate hikes promote saving and reduce borrowing; understood independence concept (like judicial independence)

---

## Key Breakthrough Moments | 关键突破点 💡

**Concepts that clicked**:

### Monetary Policy
- **Fed's independence = Judicial independence**: Student made excellent analogy on their own - avoiding short-term political pressure
- **OMO mechanism**: Quickly grasped "Buy bonds = inject money = lower rates" and reverse logic
- **Reserve requirement logic**: Understood lower requirement = more lending capacity immediately
- **Dual Mandate**: Understood the conflict between maximum employment and price stability

### Fiscal Policy
- **Speed difference**: Student identified key insight that "market sentiment changes faster" with monetary policy - excellent observation!
- **Policy coordination**: Understood Fed moves first (fast), government follows (slow but deeper impact)
- **Expansionary vs Contractionary**: Correctly identified government should spend more + cut taxes during recession

**Effective teaching approaches**:
- **Socratic questioning**: Student arrived at conclusions through guided questions
- **Scenario-based**: Recession/overheating scenarios helped cement understanding
- **Comparative learning**: Monetary vs Fiscal comparison table clarified distinctions

## Challenges Encountered | 遇到的困难 ⚠️

**Initial confusion (all resolved during session)**:
- None - student showed strong logical reasoning throughout
- All concepts were grasped on first explanation

**Strong understanding demonstrated**:
- ✅ Buy bonds = expansionary, Sell bonds = contractionary
- ✅ Lower reserve requirement = more lending = stimulus
- ✅ Fiscal policy slower than monetary policy (needs legislation)
- ✅ Expansionary fiscal = more spending + less taxes
