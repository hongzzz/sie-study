## Personal Study Notes

### Learning Insights
- **2025-12-22**: "Preferred" in finance refers to priority in dividends and liquidation (not voting priority). This was counterintuitive at first.
- **2025-12-23**: In the Primary Market (一级市场) a company raises money when it issues securities; in the Secondary Market (二级市场), trading happens between investors and the company does not receive proceeds—explains why IPOs matter so much.
- **2025-12-24**: In Firm Commitment, ownership of securities transfers to the underwriter BEFORE public sale - the company gets guaranteed money upfront regardless of market performance. This is THE key difference from Best Efforts where the company only gets what actually sells.
- **2025-12-26**: SEC = Disclosure Police, NOT Investment Advisor - this is a critical distinction. SEC never recommends investments, only ensures adequate disclosure. FINRA is industry self-regulation (SRO), not government. MSRB makes rules but doesn't enforce them - unique division of labor. Through verification scenarios: SIPC protects broker bankruptcy (按破产时账户余额), NOT investment losses; municipal bond enforcement has clear division - MSRB makes rules, FINRA enforces for brokers, SEC enforces for issuers.

### Easily Confused Concepts

| Concept A | Concept B | Key Difference |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Common Stock (普通股) | Preferred Stock (优先股) | Voting rights but junior for dividends vs typically no voting rights but senior for dividends |
| Primary Market (一级市场) | Secondary Market (二级市场) | Issuer sells new securities vs investors trade outstanding securities |
| NYSE | NASDAQ | Auction market vs dealer market |
| Dividend (股息) | Stock Buyback (回购) | Direct cash distribution (taxable) vs indirect return (often tax-deferred) |
| Firm Commitment (包销) | Best Efforts (代销) | Underwriter BUYS & assumes risk vs Underwriter SELLS as agent, issuer assumes risk |
| Syndicate Members | Selling Group | Purchase securities & assume risk vs Only sell, no risk, agent role |
| SEC Approval | SEC Recommendation | Disclosure adequate vs SEC never recommends investments |
| SEC | FINRA | Government agency (top regulator) vs Industry SRO (broker conduct) |
| SIPC Coverage | Investment Insurance | Covers broker bankruptcy vs Does NOT cover market losses |
| MSRB Rulemaking | MSRB Enforcement | Makes municipal bond rules vs Does NOT enforce (SEC/FINRA enforce) |

### Memory Aids
- **Preferred Stock (优先股) = priority in money**
- **Common Stock (普通股) = common people vote**
- **Primary Market (一级市场) = company gets primary cash**
- **Secondary Market (二级市场) = second-hand trading**
- **NYSE = old (1792), traditional**
- **NASDAQ = newer (1971), tech-heavy**
- **Stock Buyback (回购) → fewer shares → higher EPS**
- **Firm Commitment = FIRMLY guaranteed money for company**
- **Best Efforts = BEST try, but no guarantee**
- **Principal vs Agent: Principal Purchases, Agent Assists**
- **Lead-Syndicate-Selling (L-S-S) = Large, Small, Smallest (risk & compensation)**
- **SEC = referee ensuring disclosure rules, NOT coach telling you which team to bet on**
- **S-F-S-M (Safe System)**: SEC = Supreme, FINRA = Firm behavior, SIPC = Safety net, MSRB = Municipal
- **SIPC: 5-2-5 rule** = $500K total, $250K cash, 5 in both
- **MSRB Makes, Doesn't Enforce** - rulemaker only, SEC/FINRA enforce
