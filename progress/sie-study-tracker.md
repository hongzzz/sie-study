## Personal Study Notes

### Learning Insights
- **2025-12-22**: "Preferred" in finance refers to priority in dividends and liquidation (not voting priority). This was counterintuitive at first.
- **2025-12-23**: In the Primary Market (一级市场) a company raises money when it issues securities; in the Secondary Market (二级市场), trading happens between investors and the company does not receive proceeds—explains why IPOs matter so much.
- **2025-12-24**: In Firm Commitment, ownership of securities transfers to the underwriter BEFORE public sale - the company gets guaranteed money upfront regardless of market performance. This is THE key difference from Best Efforts where the company only gets what actually sells.
- **2025-12-26**: SEC = Disclosure Police, NOT Investment Advisor - this is a critical distinction. SEC never recommends investments, only ensures adequate disclosure. FINRA is industry self-regulation (SRO), not government. MSRB makes rules but doesn't enforce them - unique division of labor. Through verification scenarios: SIPC protects broker bankruptcy (按破产时账户余额), NOT investment losses; municipal bond enforcement has clear division - MSRB makes rules, FINRA enforces for brokers, SEC enforces for issuers.
- **2025-12-30**: Fed's independence = Judicial independence - excellent student analogy. Monetary Policy (Fed controls money supply via OMO/rates) vs Fiscal Policy (Government controls money flow via spending/taxes). Key insight: "market sentiment changes faster" with monetary policy. Buy bonds = inject money = lower rates; Sell bonds = withdraw money = higher rates. Understood wage-price spiral: extremely low unemployment (e.g., 2%) can trigger inflation through labor shortages and wage competition. Excellent policy prioritization: correctly identified that 8% inflation must be addressed with rate hikes even when GDP is growing strongly.
- **2025-01-09**: Started Domain 2! Deep understanding of Preferred Stock features. Key insight: "Preferred" means priority for MONEY (dividends/liquidation), NOT voting power - this was counterintuitive at first. Grasped risk-return balance principle: features favoring company → higher dividend compensation; features favoring investor → lower dividend acceptable. Strong understanding of investor matching: retirees need non-callable for stable income; young investors benefit from convertible for growth. "Best of Both Worlds" concept for convertible preferred clicked immediately. Conversion Price calculation mastered: Par Value ÷ Conversion Ratio. Practice questions: 5/5 (100%) - excellent application of all concepts.

### Easily Confused Concepts

| Concept A | Concept B | Key Difference |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Common Stock (普通股) | Preferred Stock (优先股) | Voting rights but junior for dividends vs typically no voting rights but senior for dividends |
| Primary Market (一级市场) | Secondary Market (二级市场) | Issuer sells new securities vs investors trade outstanding securities |
| NYSE | NASDAQ | Auction market vs dealer market |
| Dividend (股息) | Stock Buyback (回购) | Direct cash distribution (taxable) vs indirect return (often tax-deferred) |
| Firm Commitment (包销) | Best Efforts (代销) | Underwriter BUYS & assumes risk vs Underwriter SELLS as agent, issuer assumes risk |
| Syndicate Members | Selling Group | Purchase securities & assume risk vs Only sell, no risk, agent role |
| SEC Approval | SEC Recommendation | Disclosure adequate vs SEC never recommends investments |
| SEC | FINRA | Government agency (top regulator) vs Industry SRO (broker conduct) |
| SIPC Coverage | Investment Insurance | Covers broker bankruptcy vs Does NOT cover market losses |
| MSRB Rulemaking | MSRB Enforcement | Makes municipal bond rules vs Does NOT enforce (SEC/FINRA enforce) |
| Monetary Policy | Fiscal Policy | Fed controls money supply (OMO, rates) vs Government controls spending/taxes |
| Nominal GDP | Real GDP | Includes inflation vs Removes inflation (true growth) |
| Expansionary Policy | Contractionary Policy | Stimulate economy (recession) vs Cool economy (inflation) |
| Cumulative Preferred | Non-Cumulative Preferred | Dividends accumulate if missed vs Dividends expire if missed |
| Callable Preferred | Non-Callable Preferred | Company can redeem vs Company cannot redeem |
| Convertible Preferred | Non-Convertible Preferred | Can exchange for common stock vs Cannot convert |
| Realized Income | Unrealized Income | Cash received (dividend) vs Paper gain (unsold stock appreciation) |

### Memory Aids
- **Preferred Stock (优先股) = priority in money**
- **Common Stock (普通股) = common people vote**
- **Primary Market (一级市场) = company gets primary cash**
- **Secondary Market (二级市场) = second-hand trading**
- **NYSE = old (1792), traditional**
- **NASDAQ = newer (1971), tech-heavy**
- **Stock Buyback (回购) → fewer shares → higher EPS**
- **Firm Commitment = FIRMLY guaranteed money for company**
- **Best Efforts = BEST try, but no guarantee**
- **Principal vs Agent: Principal Purchases, Agent Assists**
- **Lead-Syndicate-Selling (L-S-S) = Large, Small, Smallest (risk & compensation)**
- **SEC = referee ensuring disclosure rules, NOT coach telling you which team to bet on**
- **S-F-S-M (Safe System)**: SEC = Supreme, FINRA = Firm behavior, SIPC = Safety net, MSRB = Municipal
- **SIPC: 5-2-5 rule** = $500K total, $250K cash, 5 in both
- **MSRB Makes, Doesn't Enforce** - rulemaker only, SEC/FINRA enforce
- **OMO: Buy = 放水, Sell = 抽水** (Open Market Operations)
- **Economic policies: 经济冷→政府热(多花少收), 经济热→政府冷(少花多收)**
- **Monetary = Fast (Fed meeting), Fiscal = Slow (legislation)**
- **Fed's Dual Mandate: Maximum Employment + Stable Prices (~2%)**
- **Recession = 2 consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth**
- **Real GDP = Nominal GDP - Inflation (true growth)**
- **CPI = basket of consumer goods (衣食住行)**
- **Natural unemployment = 4-5% (healthy level)**
- **Cumulative = Company must Catch up** (all missed dividends must be paid)
- **Callable = Company Can take it back** (when rates drop)
- **Convertible = Choice to Change** (to common stock)
- **Conversion Price = Par ÷ Ratio** (breakeven point for conversion)
- **Risk-Return Balance: Company benefits → Higher dividend; Investor benefits → Lower dividend**
- **Dividend = Realized immediately, Capital Gain = Unrealized until sold**
